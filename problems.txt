CONFIG:

--> Check if the lines are OK ✅
--> Check the requirements for configs ❌
--> Check the parameters for ROUTES ✅

--> If client attempts to upload a file or send data larger than "clien_max_body_size", than Nginx will return a 413 Request Entity Too Large error ❌
--> Check for missing information at CGI, for example, no cgi_path, but have cgi_extensions ❌
--> Duplicate extensions and duplicate paths for the CGI. Example .py .py -- /bin/python /bin/HTML ❌
