PARSING PROBLEMS

✅ ❌

CONFIG:

--> ERROR PAGE: check the first parameter if it is only numbers and check the path ✅
--> Check if the lines are OK ✅
--> Check the requirements for configs ❌
--> Check the parameters for ROUTES ✅
--> Check the root paths if they exist ??? ❌
--> Double methods and invalid methods ❌
--> If client attempts to upload a file or send data larger than "clien_max_body_size", than Nginx will return a 413 Request Entity Too Large error ❌
--> Check for missing information at CGI, for example, no cgi_path, but have cgi_extensions ❌
--> Duplicate extensions and duplicate paths for the CGI. Example .py .py -- /bin/python /bin/HTML ❌
--> We can't set more than one path to upload files ❌
--> SEG FAULT: ./webserv conf_files/good/chat ❌
--> When we have 2 extensions and only 1 path but finished with " ", for example cgi_path ../../python ; <-- Conider 2 paths cause of the space ❌

NOTES:
--> We can have more than one index, and the server will serve us the first one ❌
